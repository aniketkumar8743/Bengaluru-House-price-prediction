# Bengaluru House Price Prediction 🏠
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India. The prediction is based on several features, including location, size, square footage, amenities, and more. The goal is to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market by providing accurate price estimates.

## 📖 Overview
The Bengaluru House Price Prediction project uses advanced data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to:

Analyze key factors influencing house prices.
Build a predictive model for estimating prices.
Assist stakeholders (buyers, sellers, realtors) in evaluating property values.
## 🎯 Project Goals
Data Analysis:
Explore and understand the key features affecting house prices in Bengaluru.
Price Prediction:
Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Deployment:
Provide a simple interface for users to input property details and get price estimates.
## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

Location: Neighborhood or area within Bengaluru.
Size: Number of bedrooms (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
Total Square Footage: Size of the property in square feet.
Price: House price (target variable).
Number of Bathrooms.
Availability: Whether the property is ready to move in or under construction.
## 🔍 Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed distributions, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the data (e.g., irregular size formats).
Feature Engineering:
Created new features like price per square foot and encoded categorical variables.
Outlier Removal:
Removed properties with unusually high or low price per square foot values.
## 🏗️ Model Development
Algorithms Used:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Performance Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
R-squared (R²) score.
Best Model:

Achieved the best performance using Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with an R² score of over 90%.

## 📊 Results
XGBoost was the best-performing model with:
R² Score: 0.92
MAE: ₹1.2 lakh
RMSE: ₹1.5 lakh
Key insights:
Location and size (BHK) are the most influential factors in determining house prices.
Outliers significantly affect model performance and must be carefully removed.
## 🖥️ Future Work
Integrate a web-based user interface for real-time predictions (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask).
Expand the dataset to include more properties for better generalization.
Experiment with deep learning models for further improvements.
